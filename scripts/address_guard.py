"""The ONE implementation of "does this content carry a real operator address".

pom11/hscc is a PUBLIC repository, so a real LAN host or tailnet address that
reaches a commit is a leak, not a typo. This module is the detector; it has TWO
callers and must stay the single source of truth for the pattern:

  * ``hscc_daemon/tests/test_no_real_addresses_committed.py`` — the pytest gate,
    which scans everything git *tracks*.
  * ``.githooks/pre-commit`` — the commit-time gate (``--staged``), which scans
    the files in the index. Needed because the pytest gate only fires when
    somebody runs the suite: the 2026-10-08 leak (a ledger tick that recorded a
    verbatim ``mount_nfs`` command) was a docs-only commit that never ran it.

Detection lives HERE, not in either caller — a second regex is a second
opportunity to get it wrong, and the two gates must never disagree about what
is a leak.

Placeholders are the documented convention and are ALLOWED:
  * ``10.0.0.x``   for a LAN node
  * ``100.64.0.1`` for a tailnet host

100.64.0.0/10 is CGNAT, which is where Tailscale hands out addresses, so a real
tailnet address lives somewhere in it. Rather than ban the whole range — tests
legitimately need a tailnet-shaped host — 100.64.0.0/24 is reserved as the
SANCTIONED FIXTURE BLOCK (100.64.0.1, 100.64.0.3, ...). Anything else in CGNAT,
or anything on the live LAN, is a real address and must not be committed.

Stdlib only, no network, no config files: the pre-commit hook runs this on every
commit, so anything it costs gets paid by every commit in the repo.
